## EasyApp / BBL-Common

This software was originally developed in 2010-11 as an open source project at the University of Pennsylvania's [Brain Behavior Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/bbl/bbl_nbil.html).  It served as an underlying utility library for per-study data access website projects.  The goal was to allow easy creation of simple Struts2-based websites, with simple data creation and access.

Later, it served as a core dependency of a [custom wedding website](http://mrfeeligns.com/wedding) and a few other small projects.

In 2022, it received a long-needed upgrade to the latest Struts 2 and other dependencies, resolving security issues, and making it compatible with the Servlet 4.0 Spec.

Please see the [JavaDoc API](api/index.html) for more information.
